A sequence of N > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the difference
between successive elements take on all the values 1 through N-1. For instance:

1 4 2 3

is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and respectively. The
definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a
program to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.

INPUT
Each line of input contains an integer N<=3000 followed by n integers representing the
sequence. The values in the sequence are at most in absolute value. Input contains
at most 10 lines.

OUTPUT
For each line of input, generate a line of output saying “Jolly” or “Not jolly”

INPUT
4 1 4 2 3
5 1 4 2 -1 6

OUTPUT
Jolly
Not jolly
